KL High Rise Residential Price Modelling


I did this house price data analytic and price predicition project for my master thesis since early this year. This porject is small 
but i did enjoyed it tremendously. I got the first hand experience of getting the data, clean, analyse and finally and do the predicition
model. Suprisingly, using several line of code from pre-existing model from sklearn produce such a profound predicition accuracy. So i 
decide to write this notebook to share how I did this data analytic project. You can find how i did my web scrapping through another
repository. Enjoy
