KL High Rise Residential Price Modelling


I did this house price data analytic and price predicition project for my master thesis since early this year. This porject is small 
but i did enjoyed it tremendously. I got the first hand experience of getting the data, clean, analyse and finally and do the predicition
model. The Finalk dataset consist of 953 High Rise Residential with around 39,200 row of transactions from 2008-2016. I used dataset from 2017-2018 for training set.

Suprisingly, using several line of code from pre-existing model from sklearn produce such a profound predicition accuracy. So i 
decide to write this notebook to share how I did this data analytic project. You can find how i did my web scrapping through another
repository. I attacheed here the dfaft for my master thesis. I will reupload the final version upon completion.
