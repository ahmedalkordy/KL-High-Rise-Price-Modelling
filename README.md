KL High Rise Residential Price Modelling

## Introduction
I did this house price data analytic and price predicition project for my master thesis since early this year. This is small project that I enjoyed tremendously. I got the first hand experience of getting the data, clean, explore, transform and finally doing the predicition
model. The Final dataset consist of 953 High Rise Residential in Kuala Lumpur with around 39,200 row of transactions from 2008-2016. I used transaction dataset from 2017-2018 for the training set.

Suprisingly, using several line of code from pre-existing model from sklearn produce such a profound predicition accuracy. So I 
decide to write this notebook to share how I did this data analytic project. You can find how i did my web scrapping through another
repository. I attacheed here the dfaft for my master thesis. I will reupload the final version upon completion.
